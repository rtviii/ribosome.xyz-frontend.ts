### Ligands, Antibiotics and Small Molecules 

Crystallographic models frequently feature ligands and small molecules that are not intrinsic to the ribosome but are still of great interest whether due to their pharmacological, evolutionary or other import. We provide a residue-level catalogu of ligands, small molecules and antibiotics and their physical neighborhood as well as tools to search for similar molecules across other structures in the database.
